## Register to EBAME

* [Information about the workshop]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link about.md %})

## Who should apply

The workshop will be most useful for researchers and graduate students who study microbes via shotgun genomics, metagenomic or metatranscriptomic datasets, and are interested in genome-resolved metagenomics and pangenome analysis. Applicants from different backgrounds are most welcome (such as computer scientists or biostatisticians). Hands-on tutorials will require familiarity with the UNIX terminal environment. Please keep in mind that EBAME is a very intensive workshop with everyday lectures and little time for other activities. Before applying to EBAME, we encourage you to evaluate your commitment and availbility for such exercise.

## How to apply

An e-mail titled “EBAME 9 Application” with application material as PDF attachments should be sent to lois.maignien@univ-brest.fr. Your application can include:

* a short statement with your scientific background,
* current interests,
* the kinds of datasets you are currently working with,
* and expectations from the workshop (ideally in a single page).

Feel free to add your CV as a separate PDF file to your application. 
We will consider applications until **July 1, 2024**.

Applicants will be notified shortly after regarding participation.

Thank you for your interest and we are looking forward to meeting you in Brest!

On behalf of the workshop faculty,

-- The organizing committee.
