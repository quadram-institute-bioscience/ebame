> Viromics tutorial for the [**9th EBAME workshop**](https://maignienlab.gitlab.io/ebame/).

In this tutorial we will mine for phage sequences in a metagenome assembly.

Checking their quality, we can then select some of the predictions as candidate "Viral [OTUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Operational_taxonomic_unit)" (vOTUs).
