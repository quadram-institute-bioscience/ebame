Microbial Ecology is undergoing rapid evolution and dramatic progresses thanks to the combined advances of next-generation DNA sequencing technologies and computational approaches for data analysis and visualization. As a result, microbial ecogenomics has become an essential part of investigations of marine or terrestrial habitats, or host-microbe interactions. 
The aim of the  workshop on Emerging Bioinformatics Approaches for Microbial Ecogenomics is to bring together researchers who generate complex 'omics datasets to investigate biological, ecological and evolutionnary questions with researchers who develop new concepts and computational methods to analyze such datasets.

The workshop will have lectures on new methods and their applications on real-world datasets, and  tutorials for hands-on experience.

### Focus

The workshop will focus on various state-of-the-art data analysis practices targeting genome-resolved metagenomics including recovery of population genomes from metagenomes, analysis of micro-diversity through single-nucleotide variants, strain deconvolution, comparative genomics, application of network theory to complex metagenomic data, and data visualization.
