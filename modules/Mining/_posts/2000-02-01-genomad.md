title: geNomad

We start from raw reads of three samples and a co-assembly of them.

We will be using geNomad to identify bacteriophages and plasmids in genome/microbiome/virome assemblies. 
The tool is very easy to install, check the documentation [here](https://portal.nersc.gov/genomad/installation.html).

GeNomad utilizes an alignment-free and gene-based classifier hybrid approach to identify mobile genetic elements in a dataset and more information on how the tool works can be found in the [publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01953-y).


This section will also use [SeqFu](https://telatin.github.io/seqfu2/) for the sequences manipulation.

### Installation

GeNomad can be installed as follows:

```bash
# Note the multiline command using trailing backslashes:
mamba create -n genomad --yes \
  -c conda-forge -c bioconda \
  genomad seqfu
```

As with any conda/mamba environment, you will need to activate the environment to use the programmes within: 

```bash
conda activate genomad
```

You can now check whether the programme was installed well and is functioning by invoking the help message.

```bash
genomad --help
```



> EBAME Workshop: we already have it in our VMs at `$VIROME/db/genomad_db/`.

If you install geNomad on your own computer, you can download the database with the following command:

```bash
genomad download-database .
```

The `.` means "download the database in the current directory": you can change it to a different path if you want.


### Running geNomad

![genomad pipeline](https://portal.nersc.gov/genomad/_images/pipeline_overview.svg)

<sup>Image from <h href="https://portal.nersc.gov/genomad/">https://portal.nersc.gov/genomad/</a>.</sup>

geNomad has a set of modules, which combined compose the whole workflow. The modules are:

* **geNomad annotate** will perform gene calling in the input sequences and annotate the predicted proteins with geNomad's markers.
* **geNomad find-proviruses** will find putative proviral regions within the input sequences.
* **geNomad marker-classification** will classify the input sequences into chromosome, plasmid, or virus based on the presence of geNomad markers and other gene-related features. 
* **geNomad nn-classification** will classify the input sequences into chromosome, plasmid, or virus based on the nucleotide sequence.
* **geNomad aggregated-classification** will aggregate the results of the *marker-classification* and *nn-classification* modules to classify the input sequences into chromosome, plasmid, or virus. 
* **geNomad summary** will summarize the results across modules into a classification report.

We will use the `end-to-end` command to run the full geNomad pipeline
(remember to use `genomad --help` to look at the options/parameters you can choose,
and remember to modify the command to suit your own inputs, outputs and desired options).

To run genomad you will need:

1. The assembly (FASTA file)
2. The database directory

and you need to specify the output directory of course. 

:pencil2: You can try and create the command to run using `genomad end-to-end --help` to see the manual, or just read below.

```bash
genomad end-to-end $VIROME/human_gut_assembly.fa.gz ~/genomad-out  $VIROME/genomad_db/ -t 8
```

The parameters are:
* `<ASSEMBLY>`, 
* `<OUTPUT_DIR>`, 
* `<DB_DIR>`, 
* `-t INT` for the number of threads.


:eyes: Check the information printed on the screen. At the end geNomad will tell where the important files are!


### Main output file

:pencil2: What file contains the predicted viral genomes? How many sequences are there?


```bash
seqfu stats -nbt ~/genomad-out/human_gut_assembly_summary/human_gut_assembly_virus.fna
```

* `-n` will print a table nice to see in the terminal (by default is TSV)
* `-b` will use the basename of the file instead of the full path, this saves some space
* `-t` to add thousands separators



When we're finished using this programme, we can deactivate the conda environment:

```bash
conda deactivate
```

Note that when deactivating an environment you do not need to specify the name, this is only true when activating an environment.

### Renaming a FASTA file

The sequence names given by geNomad are not the favourite for some tools like Anvi'o (well, some dependencies of Anvi'o).

Let's have a look at the sequence names first: note that at the end there are unwanted characters.


We can use SeqFu to rename the sequences: we can use a new shortcut `--anvio`:

```bash
# To make commands easier, we can use variable like:
GENOMAD_OUT=~/genomad-out/human_gut_assembly_summary/human_gut_assembly_virus.fna 

# to be recalled with $VARNAME
seqfu cat --anvio --report rename_report.txt $GENOMAD_OUT > ~/genomad-out/genomad_votus.fna
```

We will now consider `~/genomad-out/genomad_votus.fna` to be our final output of geNomad.

:bulb: This command also spits a mapping file (`rename_report.txt`) that can be useful to track the changes.
