## What are SSH keys?

## Creating your SSH key

:bulb: if you already have one, you are golden

Open your terminal. We can start checking if we ever had created an SSH key before:

```bash
ls -l ~/.ssh/*
```

If you see some files you might have already created an SSH key. In any case we can create a new one:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa  -N ""
```

now if you try again the *ls* command  you should see two files:

```text
~/.ssh/id_rsa
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
* `id_rsa` is your private key, keep it safe! is like your **key**
* `id_rsa.pub` is your public key, you can share it with the world! is like your **lock**, and you can add it to a server so that you can enter with your key.

to see your public key:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

:bulb: From a Mac, you can copy the public key to your clipboard with:

```bash
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
