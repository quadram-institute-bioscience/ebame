VisiData is handy as it let us quickly check some tabular data without needing 
to download the file.

## Genomad Output

This tutorial will guide you through using VisiData (vd) to analyze the output of genomad, which is a TSV file with the following columns:

* seq_name,
* length,
* topology,
* coordinates,
* n_genes,
* genetic_code,
* virus_score,
* fdr,
* n_hallmarks,
* marker_enrichment,
* taxonomy

## Getting Started

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing your genomad output file.
2. Launch VisiData by typing: `vd FILENAME`

example:

```bash
vd ~/genomad-out/human_gut_assembly_summary/human_gut_assembly_virus_summary.tsv
```

## Basic Navigation

* Use arrow keys to move around the spreadsheet.
* You can use your mouse!
* Press `q` to quit VisiData (you'll be prompted to confirm).
* When opening a different view, press `Esc` to go back or undo an action


## Setting Column Types and sorting

1. Move to the "length" column.
2. Press `#` to set it as an integer type.
3. Move to the "virus_score" column.
4. Press `%` to set it as a float type.
5. Now you can **sort** these columns using `[` and `]`


### Frequency Analysis

1. Move to the "topology" column.
2. Press `Shift+F` to show frequency.
3. This will create a new sheet showing the frequency of each unique value in the topology column.
4. Use `Esc` to return to the main sheet.


### Selecting Columns by Pattern

Let's select rows in the "coordinates" column with "NA" as a value and remove them:

1. Move to the "coordinates" column.
2. Press `|` (pipe character) to open the select menu.
3. Type `NA` and press Enter. This selects all rows where "coordinates" is "NA".
4. Press `d` to delete the selected rows.
5. Press `Enter` to confirm the deletion.

## Tips

* Use `Shift+?` to open the help menu for a full list of commands.
* Press `Ctrl+Q` to quit without saving changes, or `Shift+S` to save your work.

Remember, `Esc` is your friend! Use it whenever you want to go back or undo an action.
