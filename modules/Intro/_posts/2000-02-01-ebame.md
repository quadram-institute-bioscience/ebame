## Create your VM

Go to [BioSphere](https://biosphere.france-bioinformatique.fr/) and create a new VM with the following settings:

* UBUNTU 22.04 (**not** desktop)
* 32 Gb of RAM

1. Follow this link will bring you to the [Ubuntu 22 image](https://biosphere.france-bioinformatique.fr/catalogue/appliance/228/)
2. Click on "Run" then "Advanced configuration and run" 
3. Give your VM a nice name
4. Choose the `ifb.m4.2xlarge (8 vCPU, 32GB GB RAM, 200GB GB local disk)` configuration.
5. Click "Start now"

## Setting up your EBAME VM

We made a small script to help you set up your VM.

Execute it from the terminal:
```bash
# Execute a script to install some dependencies and configure variables and screen
curl -sSL https://gist.githubusercontent.com/telatin/593b5b7ce54fc644725e0ecc02394d34/raw/425aa2c09ca4cfcbf3bc341dcf4fa67663fb1dd5/setup_vm.sh | bash
```

Finally:

```bash
# Make conda ready to work
conda init bash

# Apply modified settings
source ~/.bashrc
```

  <summary>What is this script doing?</summary>
  
  The script will check if you are on an EBAME VM. Then will install some dependencies, and make a bookmark for the data directory.

## Using GNU Screen

:warning: if the connection to a remote machine drops, the running programs will be terminated.

See a small tutorial on [GNU screen :link:](https://github.com/telatin/learn_bash/wiki/Using-%22screen%22) on how to manage this problem.
