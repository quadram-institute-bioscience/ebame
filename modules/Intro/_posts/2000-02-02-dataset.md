We have three Illumina shotgun sequencing experiments from VLP enriched samples coming from human guts.

We performed a co-assembly (from [this study :link:](https://doi.org/10.1099/mgen.0.001236)).


## Get the reads

> Skip this part if you are using the EBAME VM.


To download the files to your computer you need to download the raw sequences from [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJEB47625) and the assembly file 'illumina_sample_pool_megahit.fa.gz' from the [Zenodo archive](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10650983). 

You can either go manually download these files or you can run the following script:

```bash
# We create a dedicated directory
mkdir virome-data
cd virome-data
# We can use a variable to bookmark the directory
export VIROME=$(pwd)

# Download the files
wget https://zenodo.org/api/records/10650983/files/illumina_sample_pool_megahit.fa.gz/content -O illumina_sample_pool_megahit.fa.gz
curl -L ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR679/005/ERR6797445/ERR6797445_1.fastq.gz -o ERR6797445_1.fastq.gz
curl -L ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR679/005/ERR6797445/ERR6797445_2.fastq.gz -o ERR6797445_2.fastq.gz
curl -L ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR679/004/ERR6797444/ERR6797444_1.fastq.gz -o ERR6797444_1.fastq.gz

curl -L ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR679/003/ERR6797443/ERR6797443_1.fastq.gz -o ERR6797443_1.fastq.gz
curl -L ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR679/003/ERR6797443/ERR6797443_2.fastq.gz -o ERR6797443_2.fastq.gz
```

## On the EBAME VM

Try:
```bash
# View the content of the variable
echo $VIROME

# List what's inside it
ls -l $VIROME
```

You have three paired-end Illumina FASTQ files in this directory:

* `$VIROME/ERR679744*`

And a single co-assembly of them:

* `$VIROME/human_gut_assembly.fa`

:pencil2: Some questions:

* How many sequences are there in the assembly? What is its N50?
* How many reads do we have in our samples?

  ### How many sequences in a FASTA file
  With bash, you can count the ">" like:
  ```bash
  grep -c ">" ${my_assembly.fa
  ```

  but since we have a gzip file for our assembly we can use a similar command "zgrep"
  ```bash
  zgrep -c ">" $VIROME/human_gut_assembly.fa.gz
  ```

  Or we can use a dedicated tool, called [SeqFu stats](https://telatin.github.io/seqfu2/tools/stats.html) :
  ```bash
  seqfu cnt $VIROME/human_gut_assembly.fa.gz
  ```

  ### How many reads in FASTQ files?
  A quick way is to count the lines and divide them by four, or count the lines being "+":
  ```bash
  cat $VIROME/ERR6797443_1.fastq.gz | gzip -dc | grep -cw "+"
  ```
