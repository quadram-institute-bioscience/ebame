title: Linking to Anvio'
---

You can do the Anvi'o data processing yourself on your own computer using the anvio install that you have used earlier in the week. We will provide the necessary files for you to download from [FigShare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27231678) so you don't have to worry about downloading your files from the VM.
