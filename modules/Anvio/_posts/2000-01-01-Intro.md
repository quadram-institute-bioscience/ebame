You can do the Anvi'o data processing yourself on your own computer using the Anvi'o install that you have used earlier in the week. 

:package: We will provide the necessary files for you to download from [FigShare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27231678) so you don't have to worry about downloading your files from the VM.
